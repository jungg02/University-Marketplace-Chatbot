## Marketplace Insights
Main requirements of the chatbot includes being able to assist users with frequently asked questions on platform navigation, use of platform features and answer basic queries. Queries that violates policies or more complex issues should be raised to the human moderator while gathering necessary information

The chatbot needs to be able to maintain a safe yet reliable environment for university students by enforcing community guidelines and preventing any acts which may harm the well-being of students. Hence, it will need to be able to navigate the nuances in natural language while dealing with common user pain points in current student marketplaces such as online "trolls", pervasive in all online communities, inadequate user support, incomplete or inconsistent information, or security and safety concerns. 

"Ghosting", where sellers or buyers completely ignores messages from the other party, and "low-balling", whereby buyers consistently offer heavily marked down prices for a certain product from the price it was listed, are just some of the other common problems faced by users on online marketplace platforms.

The chatbot is also likely to expect higher traffic during graduation, textbook sales, move-in and move-out periods. Hence, it will need to be able to handle a likely increase in number of queries.

While users of campus communities are generally more credible, scams still do exist in university marketplaces to varying degrees. Students may also let their guard down and be overly trusting simply because of the fact that he or she assumes that the other party is a fellow student. Therefore, detailed textual and photographic documentation of product quality would be required of sellers in order to ensure transparency and minimise misinformation between buyers and sellers.

The chatbot and marketplace as a whole would also need to be integrated with various university systems. Thus common areas such as student cards, school emails or student number can be used as a form of verification by the marketplace as a way to ensure user authencity.
