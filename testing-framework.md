## Testing Framework
These test cases were designed to come from the perspectives of both buyers and sellers based on the functionalities of the marketplace they will frequently use as well as other common experiences. It also proposes some edge cases which are quite common in the real world, hence it is essential that the chatbot is able to give the right response to such types of queries. These test cases were also designed such that they do not have to be updated with every chatbot version updates but can remain as the "Golden Test" to assess the chatbot's performance unless there is a need for such a change.(eg. massive policy shifts) 

By considering some of the frequently asked questions that each party may have, it ensures that the chatbot can give a valid response to majority of use cases in the marketplace and effectively fulfill its role. The test cases were structured such that they cover a broad range of topics for both buyers and sellers, ensuring a wider coverage in testing the chatbot's ability to respond to different types of questions.

For cases where escalation to a human moderator is necessary, issues were also given different escalation priorities(immediate and normal) based on how urgent the matter is. For example, a scenario where buyer are trying to purchase drugs or weapons on the marketplace is given a higher priority compared to resolving a long price dispute between 2 parties.
