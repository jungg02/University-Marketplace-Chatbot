# University-Marketplace-Chatbot

## Future Actions
- Further support for more complex common marketplace issues such as "scalpers", "lowballing" and "ghosting" can be provided with further training to improve user experience.
- Use RAG and web scraper tool to continuously update the chatbot with context on changes to dorm policies and for a more targeted response(ie. specific to type of housing, university etc.)

## Assumptions 
- Assume that the context for this marketplace is set in Singapore.
- Assume that most universities in Singapore follow the same general guidelines on prohibited items in student accomodations.
- Assume that the marketplace already has an existing user base of both buyers and sellers.
- Assume that there is a team of human moderators ready to attend to any escalation of events.
